    Edge Cases
=====================

You: Where to go?
========
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you plan a trip! Could you please specify a bit more about where you're thinking of going? For example, do you prefer a city adventure, a beach getaway, or a nature escape? Also, let me know your approximate travel dates or duration if you have them in mind. Once I have a bit more info, I can suggest the perfect destination for you!

You: take me to jupiter for 5 days
========
Assistant: I'm sorry, but I must clarify that traveling to Jupiter isn't possible as it's a planet in our solar system and not a destination for human travel. Could I suggest an exciting real-world destination instead? How about a 5-day trip to a vibrant city like Orlando, Florida, known for its theme parks like Disney World? Let me know if you'd like suggestions for another location or type of getaway, and I'll be happy to help!
